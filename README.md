# basic_tools

Whenever I installed Kali Linux I had to make changes to sources file and update it and search and download few tools which are not a part of Kali repo. I was just tired of doing all these over and over again so I made it in a bash script.

## What it does?

It edits your sources.list file and updates it. 
Adds 32bit architecture to the system and installs wine32.
Adds mingw32 cross-compiler, updates Metasploit.
Adds EternalBlue Metasploit module. 
Installs tools like CrackMapExec, Empire, Sublist3r, BruteSpray, psychoPATH, BEWgor, MimiPenguin and Mimikatz-JS, EyeWitness, Dirs3arch, CMSmap, MITMf.

This is just a run and install script. Feel free to modify and add new good and essential tools to the script.
